Zero-Gravity Soccer
===================

This game uses Python 3.6 and Pygame 1.9.3; however, the game has been packaged in standalone form, so no installation of any libraries is required.

To start the game manually (e.g. if the shortcut does not work), enter the data folder and run zgsoccer.exe. Use the arrow keys to navigate the menu.
